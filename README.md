# Introducing Totality!

Totality is an easy-to-use goal/habit tracker for iOS and Android developed using React Native, Expo and Formik.

At the moment there is only a unitless daily tracker that has to be reset manually, but automatic resets, units and weekly, monthly and annual trackers are on the way along with history! It will also provide a mechanism to break down large goals so you have a plan to achieve them. After all, you can't learn a language in a day. 

And let me know if you have any ideas or found any bugs :)
