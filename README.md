# Introducing Totality!

Totality is an easy-to-use goal/habit tracker for iOS and Android developed using React Native, Expo and Formik.

At the moment there is only a unitless daily tracker that has to be reset manually, but automatic resets, units and weekly, monthly and annual trackers are on the way along with history! There may even be integrations with the iOS Health API so stay tunedðŸ‘€

And let me know if you have any ideas or found any bugs :)

### Update them using the + and - buttons

The UI for each goal is color-coded. It's pink if you've completed less than 50% of your goal, yellow if less than 100% and green if you've completed that goal. The tracker at the top updates automatically whenever you complete a goal.
