# Introducing Totality!

Totality is an easy-to-use goal/habit tracker for iOS and Android developed using React Native, Expo and Formik.

At the moment there is only a daily tracker that has to be reset manually, but weekly, monthly and annual trackers are on the way along with history! There may even be integrations with the iOS Health API so stay tunedðŸ‘€
